# Elections Plugin
The Elections plugin allows elections and polls to be run on your site.

This plugin is largely based on the original Polls plugin, with a few additional features
or improvements. See CHANGELOG.md for more information.

This plugin uses `gettext` to handle language strings, offering better handling
of plurals and a more standard translation process. As gettext support in
Windows is spotty, a full PHP implementation of gettext is supplied.
